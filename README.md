# Node Fortune Cookie Project
"You will live long enough to open many fortune cookies". If that is true, then thankfully these cookies have zero calories! They don't add on to you or your browser storage! Simply click the button to read your fortune!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This was built with a focus on Node.js. The smallest amount of HTML, CSS and JS was used. The user clicks a button that runs a JS async function. Node.js runs a random number function, references that index of an array of fortunes and returns said fortune to the DOM.

## Optimizations

This project was built quickly and the visuals need a major facelist. More fortunes can be added. Possibly referencing an API vs having a large array would be prefereable as well. 

## Lessons Learned:

A lot was learned about Node.js on this project. Trying to use arrow functions and switch case in leu of tradional syntax proved to be an additional challenge as well.
